# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for [TaskJuggler](https://taskjuggler.org/), written in C.

The project supports TaskJuggler v3 and does not support earlier versions.

## Dependencies

Depends on:
- cJSON
- Flex
- Bison

## Architecture

To be documented as the codebase develops. Expected structure:
- LSP server handling JSON-RPC communication
- TaskJuggler `.tjp`/`.tji` file parser
- Language features: diagnostics, completion, hover, go-to-definition

## Code Style Conventions

Use snake_case rather than camelCase for multi-word identifiers.

Use K&R C style for code.

Use spaces instead of tabs, and use four spaces per indent.

Prefer full words rather than abbreviations for naming. For example, "token_end_line" rather than "tok_el".
